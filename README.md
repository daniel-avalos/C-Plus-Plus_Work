# C++ Labwork

A collection of C++ classwork hosted for posterity and reference. Constructed using CLion and WSL toolkit.
Special thanks to Professor Kimbery Jorgenson for her guidance and clarity in code review.

    Lab 1 - Stdin/Out
            A - Calculates pay cheque amounts for bi-weekly and bi-monthly
            B - Calculates player height from raw inches to ft/in

    Lab 2 - If/Else Branching
            Traduct Order quantity to pre-tax total, using const software price and discount table            

    Lab 3 - Basic input validadation
            Gather sales figures for 4 districts (w/ input validation). Determine highest grossing division

    Lab 4 - Classes (Constructors, Setters, Getters)
            Given population, number of births, and number of deaths. Calcultes and displays birth and deathrates

    Lab 5 - Min/Max vals, array pointer passing
            Given monthly water consumptions, displays table, min, max, avg, total

    Lab 6 - Array Sorting (Bubble and Selection), Classes, self adj tables
           Prompt user for Artist and Titles, to create a playlist. Playlist is sorted via Bubble and Selection sorting, and a time comparison between the two (times measured in ms, so a faster interpreter will show no difference. Best viewed in slower web or nested interpreter)).
            Displays playlist in a self sizing table

    Lab 7 - Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation.
            Create an array of x length, dynamically assigned based on user input
            Sort list, find average, and destroy dynamically allocated memory

    Lab 8 - Filestream
            Simple file Encrypt/Decrypt (Ascii value shift)
